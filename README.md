Flet StoryBoard is an easy to use tool for building graphical interfaces based on the flet library. Powerful interfaces with simple usability.
You can use these tools with only two main and simple functions!

## Goal 🏁
My goal is making this more powerful and bigger to a allow programmers to build front-end & `flet` controls with just a simple GUI window, and no front-end coding require.
